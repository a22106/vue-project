# Section1. What's Vue.js
- `JavaScript`: supported by all browser
- `framework`: third party library
- `reactive`: click -> react
- `web frontends`: HTML + CSS + JavaScript

## "Just JavaScript" Not Be Ideal!
- No framework like Vue is needed!
  - but don't need to write the all code yourself
  - You might write suboptimal code or introduce errors & bugs
  - Working in a team might be harder because not everyone knows you structure and "code philosophy"

## Various Vue.js usage
1. control parts of HTML pages or entire pages.
   - Widget, (some) pages are still rendered on and served by a backend server
2. control the entire frontend of an app
   - SPA(Single Page Application), Server only sends one HTML page

## Vue Alternatives
```
Vue vs React vs Angular

```
1. React.js
   - component based UI library.
2. Angular
   - Complete component-based UI framework, packed with features. Can be overkill for smaller projects(too much features).
